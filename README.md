Advent of Code 2023 


Trying to learn Rust so writing as many of my solutions in it as possible :)


Notes:


Day 2: Can technically ignore the semicolons and not split games up, but in the end you still iterate over the same number of strings/text so not a huge deal. 

Day 3: Lacked time, so wrote it in Python. Will transcribe to Rust later on -- need to read more documentation regarding Vectors. 

Day 5: Part 2 range mapping was conceptually difficult for a bit, so wrote it out in Python. Will rewrite in Rust later :)
